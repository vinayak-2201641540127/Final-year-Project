DataVaultX: Secure Decentralized Data Storage Platform

1. About the Project
DataVaultX is a SaaS platform designed to securely store and manage user data using decentralized cloud storage and advanced cryptography. Built with a microservices-based architecture using the MERN stack, it ensures data privacy through encryption with Crypt.js and secure authentication via blockchain-based crypto wallets. AWS S3 is used as the primary cloud storage, and the system organizes user data using labels and tags for quick and intuitive access.
